# Real-Time Network Intrusion Detection System

ðŸ“¡ **Real-Time Network Intrusion Detection System** is a machine learning-powered application designed to monitor and analyze network traffic in real-time. It detects and classifies various types of network intrusions, ensuring enhanced network security.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Captures live network traffic and processes it in real-time.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Uses a trained machine learning model to classify network traffic into categories such as:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Legitimate Network Traffic
  - ðŸ”´ DDoS Attack Detected
  - ðŸ”´ Protocol Exploitation Detected
  - ðŸ”´ Reconnaissance Detected
  - ðŸ”´ Traffic Manipulation Detected
  - ðŸ”´ Buffer Overflow Detected
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize network traffic and predictions using an intuitive Streamlit-based UI.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to include additional features or integrate with other systems.
